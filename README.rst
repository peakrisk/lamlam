From LamLam to Everest
======================

Tales of adventure, through hills and dales, over peaks and bridges,
from islands in the sea, to clouds in the sky, across the sea and
through the sky to the peak of Everest and the universe beyond.

An infinite cast of magical characters with infinite enigma variations.

Ghost:

        [Beneath] Swear.

HAMLET:

        Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
        A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.

HORATIO:

        O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

HAMLET:

        And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
        There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
        Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.



Mount Lamlam
============

Mount Lamlam (meaning lightning in Chamoru) is a peak on the United
States island of Guam. It is located near the village of Agat (5 km or
3 mi[3] north), in the southwest of the island.

Rising to 406 meters (1,332 ft) above sea level, it is the highest
peak in Guam (before Mount Jumullong Manglo). The distance from the
peak to the bottom of the nearby Mariana Trench is the greatest change
in elevation on Earth over such a short distance.

So, if you go to Guam and make the modest 1300 foot climb you can
arguably claim to be on the tallest mountain on earth.
