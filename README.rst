Mount Lamlam
============

Mount Lamlam (meaning lightning in Chamoru) is a peak on the United
States island of Guam. It is located near the village of Agat (5 km or
3 mi[3] north), in the southwest of the island.

Rising to 406 meters (1,332 ft) above sea level, it is the highest
peak in Guam (before Mount Jumullong Manglo). The distance from the
peak to the bottom of the nearby Mariana Trench is the greatest change
in elevation on Earth over such a short distance.

So, if you go to Guam and make the modest 1300 foot climb you can
arguably claim to be on the tallest mountain on earth.
