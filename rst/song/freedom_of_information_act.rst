Worried Man Blues(n, fish)
==========================

[It takes a worried man,
 To sing a woried song]  * 8

I'm worried now,
I won't be worried long.

[I shared a little data,
 with the entire world] * 8

When I woke up,
I had shackles on my feet.

[I found a little freedom,
from the entire world] * 8

When I woke up,
I found a world to love.

[I gave a little freedom,
 to the entire world] * 8

When I woke up,
I found a world in love.

[It takes a woman free,
 To get a man to listen] * 8

When we woke up,
We found a world of freedom
